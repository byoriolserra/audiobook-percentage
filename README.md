# Audiobook Percentage

With this app, you will be able to calculate the read percentage of your audiobook.

Although it is a very simple concept, I always have to manually calculate the percentage of my _Audible_ audiobooks, as they don't facilitate a percentage automatically. Therefore, to be able to log my activity on _Goodreads_, I have created this program for personal use, and published it for anyone that might need it too. Feel free to make suggestions to improve the code ;)
 
## Usage

```shell
npm install -g audiobook-percentage

audiobook-percentage
```

### Input
- **Total hours**: the total amount of hours the book has. **(HH:MM format)**
- **Left hours**: the amount of hours left to complete the book. **(HH:MM format)**

### Output
- The percentage you have already read.


Happy reading! ðŸ“–
